##### First go to official website (https://git-scm.com/download/linux) and download git for linux os
I prefer Ubuntu linux so for the latest stable version, I used the following command:

# apt-get install git -y

****** Verify whether git installed or not by using 'git --version' command ********
 
##### After downloading and installing git, how can you start tracking project code???? by configuring it

$$$$ Every command in git starts with 'git'

***************** One time used commands or global configurations or parameters: 
To understand who has written a particular code in remote repo while multiple developers are working *********************

git config --global user.name "<github_account_name>"
git config --global user.email "<github_emailaddress>"
git config --list

Daily used commands
===================

git init : git will create 3 stages/areas internally which we can't see physically but exists in the backend

1. Working directory: contains files in a current local directory that we're working on
2. Staging/Cache area: It's a temporary area where we add files with git add command
3. Local repository: We need to perform commit operation that moves the files from the staging area
                     to local repository

git status  : a command used to display the current state of the repository. When you run git status, Git provides information about:
------------  Branch Information, Staged and Unstaged Changes, Untracked Files

git add <file_name> : This command stages (from working directory to staging area) a specific/particular file for the next commit
--------------------  Replace <file_name> with the actual name of the file you want to stage

git add . : This command stages (from working directory to staging area) all changes in the current directory and its subdirectories
----------  It's a convenient way to stage multiple files or all changes at once
            The dot represents the current directory

git commit -m "<message>" :  a command used to create a new commit in your repository. This command combines two steps:
-------------------------    Staging Changes: It assumes that you have already used git add to stage the changes you want to include in the commit
                             Creating a Commit: The -m is used to add a message to the commit. This message should briefly describe the changes or the purpose of the commit

git commit -am "<message>" : a shorcut way to stage all modified files and create a commit with a message in one single step
--------------------------

git commit --amend -am "<message>" : command used to amend/modify the most recent/last commit by changing its commit message before pushing it
-----------------------------------  

git commit --amend --no-edit : command used to amend/modify the most recent/last commit without changing its commit message before pushing it
-----------------------------

git rebase -i HEAD~N : It's an interactive rebase in Git. Here's what each part of the command does:
--------------------   git rebase: This command is used to reapply commits on top of another base commit. It's a powerful tool for rewriting commit history
                       -i: This flag stands for "interactive". It tells Git that you want to perform an interactive rebase, which means you'll have the opportunity to choose which commits to include, edit commit messages, and perform other operations
                       HEAD~N: This specifies the commit you want to use as the new base for the rebase. HEAD refers to the current commit, and ~N means "N commits before HEAD". So, HEAD~N refers to the commit N steps back from the current one
                       For example, if you use git rebase -i HEAD~3, you'll be performing an interactive rebase with the last three commits

git rebase -i <commit-id> : It's an interactive rebase in Git just like git rebase -i HEAD~N
-------------------------   However, in this case, you're specifying a specific commit to serve as the base for the rebase operation

git config --global alias.<alias_name> <git_command> : a command used to create a custom alias for a Git command
-----------------------------------------------------  This alias allows you to use a shorter or more memorable name for a frequently used Git command

===========================================================================================================================================================================

git mv <old_file_name> <new_file_name> : a command used to rename or move a file in a Git repository while simultaneously staging the change for the next commit
---------------------------------------

git rm -f <file_name> : a command used to remove a file from both the working directory and the Git repository
---------------------   This means the file will be deleted from your local file system as well as from the Git history

git rm --cached <filename> : a command used to remove a file from Git repo without deleting it from your local file system
---------------------------  This means the file will be untracked, but it will still exist in your working directory

git clean : a command used to remove untracked files from the working directory
---------

git clean -–dry-run : a command used to preview the files that would be deleted from the working directory 
-------------------
 
git clean -f : a command used to permanently remove untracked files from the working directory of a Git repository
-------------  -f: This option stands for "force". It ensures that the clean operation is carried out without asking for confirmation

git clean -f -d : a command used to remove untracked files and directories from the working directory of a Git repository, including untracked directories
---------------

git clean -f -d -x : a command used to perform a more aggressive cleanup of untracked files and directories in a Git repository 
------------------   -x: This option is used to remove untracked files that are ignored by git. This can include files listed in your .gitignore file.

==================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================

git log : a command used in Git to display list of commits in a repository. For understanding the history of a Git repository, and it's often used to track changes, identify when specific features or bug fixes were introduced, and more
-------   It provides information about each commit, including the commit hash, author, date, and commit message

git shortlog : a command used to generate a summary of Git commits, grouped by author
------------   It's particularly useful for getting a quick overview of who has been contributing to a project and how many commits each author has made

git log --all : a command used to display the commit history of all branches in the repository, including local and remote branches
-------------

git log --oneline : a command used to display a condensed version of the commit history in a Git repository 
------------------  It provides a single-line summary for each commit, showing only the commit hash and the commit message

git log --since <YYYY-MM-DD> --until <YYYY-MM-DD>: a command used to filter the commit history based on a specific date range
-------------------------------------------------  This allows you to view only the commits that were made within that range

git log --author "<author_name>" : a command used to filter the commit history based on the author's name 
---------------------------------  This allows you to view only the commits made by a specific author

git log --author "<Author Name>" "<filename>" : a command used to filter the commit history based on both the author's name and a specific file
----------------------------------------------  This command will display commits made by a specific author that affected a particular file

git log --grep "<key_word>" :  a command used to search the commit history for commits that contain a specific keyword or phrase in their commit messages
----------------------------

git log -n : a command used to limit the number of commits displayed in the output
----------   The -n option is followed by a number, which determines how many of the latest commits you want to see

git log <file_name> : a command used to display the commit history of a specific file
--------------------  It shows the commits that have affected the specified file, along with their commit messages, authors, dates, and commit hashes

git log | wc -l : a command used to count the number of commits in a Git repository
----------------

git log --graph --decorate : a command used to display the commit history in a graphical and decorated format
---------------------------  This is particularly useful for visualizing branches, merges, and commit references

git diff <old commit id>..<new commit id> : a command used to view the changes between two specific commits in a Git repository
-----------------------------------------

git show <commit id> : a command used to display detailed information about a specific commit in a Git repository
---------------------  It provides a summary of the changes introduced by that commit, including the commit message, author, date, and the actual changes made to the files

============================================================================================================================================================

vi .gitignore : opens the git ignore file in the Vi text editor. 
--------------  The .gitignore file is used to specify which files and directories should be ignored by git

*.txt
*.java
*.php
*.py
*.sh
*.net

<any filename starting with or not starting with any specific letter>
!c.*
d.*
[aeiou].*
!<wanted_file_name>.<any_ignored_extension>

git branch : a command used to manage branches in a git repository. When used without any additional arguments, 
----------   it displays a list of existing branches along with an indication of the currently active branch

git branch <branch_name> : a command used to create a new branch in a git repository with the specified name
------------------------

git checkout <branch_name> : a command used to switch between different branches in a git repository
--------------------------   This command allows you to move your working directory to a different branch, making it the active branch

git branch -D/-d <branch_name> : <branch_name>: This is the name of the branch you want to delete
------------------------------   -D: This option stands for "force delete". It's used to permanently delete the branch, even if it has unmerged changes
                                 -d: This option stands for "delete". It's used to delete the branch, but only if all the changes in the branch have been merged

----------------------------------   This is a convenient shortcut that combines the creation and checkout steps into one command

git diff <target_branch>..<source_branch: a command used to view the differences between two branches in a git repository
----------------------------------------  <target_branch>: This is the branch you want to compare against
                                          <source_branch>: This is the branch you want to compare from

==================================================================================================================================================

git reflog : a command used to display a detailed history of operations that have been performed in a git repository. 
----------   It provides a log of references updates (e.g., branch creations, commits, checkouts) which is 
             particularly useful for recovering lost commits or branches

git checkout -b <deleted branch_name> <HEAD> : a command to recreate/recover a branch that has been deleted previously and move into receovered branch
--------------------------------------------
